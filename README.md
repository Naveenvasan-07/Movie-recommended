# Movie Recommendation System

This project implements a hybrid movie recommendation system using:

-  Content-Based Filtering (based on user genre preferences)
- Collaborative Filtering (based on user rating similarity via cosine similarity)

---

##  Dataset

The system uses simple example data:

- `movies`: movieId, title, genres  
- `ratings`: userId, movieId, rating  

You can also expand the dataset using real-world sources like TMDb or MovieLens.

##  Technologies Used

- Python 3.x  
- pandas  
- scikit-learn (for cosine similarity)
